# ratio : A simple distributed rate limiter made in go

## Overview [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/smoya/ratio)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/smoya/ratio)

Ratio is a distributed rate limiter designed for being used by any of your webservices.

It has been designed based on the following goals:

- Minimal response times.
- Requests can come from multiple sources and services.
- Limits don't have to be strictly enforced. Consistency can be eventual.

## Installation

### Docker

A part from the `Dockerfile`, this project also includes a `docker-compose.yaml` in order to spin up a basic set of 
`ratio` + `redis` as storage.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The GRPC server will be up and running, accessible via `localhost:50051`.

### Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes
```

It will create a service with only one instance. Please modify the files in [deploy/kubernetes](deploy/kubernetes) 
accordingly with your needs.

> Note: For simplification, the ratio is deployed with the `inmemory` slide window storage. We encourage to deploy it 
> with Redis as Storage, as the `inmemory` is not meant to be used in production.

#### Development

[Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold) can build a Docker image locally and deploy it to 
your cluster without pushing it to any repository. Please install it following the [
official docs](https://skaffold.dev/docs/getting-started/#installing-skaffold)

Then run:

```bash
skaffold run
```

## Documentation

Please find ratio documentation in the [/docs](/docs) directory.

## Build

This project was tested and compiled with Go 1.12. Even though it will probably compile in lower versions, we strongly 
recommend using, at least, the mentioned one.

### Dependencies

This project manage its dependencies via [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

Go modules automatically fetches the dependencies on compile time so no extra step should be performed.
However, make sure your `GO111MODULE` env var is set to `true`, otherwise go modules will not be activated.

### GRPC and Protobuf 

In order to compile protobuf files, please download the `protoc` compiler. Please find the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/README.md#protocol-compiler-installation).

The protobuf files can be found in [/api/proto](/api/proto) and the Go code can be regenerated by simply run:

```go
go generate ./...
``` 

#### Command line client
In case you want to do some calls to the server, you can install the `grpc_cli` tool from 
[here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/command_line_tool.md). 

Example:

```bash
grpc_cli call localhost:50051 RateLimit "owner: 'my-awesome-service', resource: '/v1/user/register'"
```
