## Build

This project was tested and compiled with Go 1.12. Even though it will probably compile in lower versions, we strongly 
recommend using, at least, the mentioned one.

### Dependencies

This project manage its dependencies via [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

Go modules automatically fetches the dependencies on compile time so no extra step should be performed.
However, make sure your `GO111MODULE` env var is set to `true`, otherwise go modules will not be activated.

### GRPC and Protobuf 

In order to compile protobuf files, please download the `protoc` compiler. Please find the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/README.md#protocol-compiler-installation).

The protobuf files can be found in [/api/proto](/api/proto) and the Go code can be regenerated by simply run:

```go
go generate ./...
```
